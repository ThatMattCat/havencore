# Agent Service

The core AI agent — Python + FastAPI + a built-in SvelteKit dashboard, all served from a single port (6002). Handles conversation, tool calling, conversation history, per-turn metrics, OpenAI-compatible endpoints for the voice pipeline, and proxies to sibling services for the dashboard playgrounds.

## Subtopics

- [Tools (MCP servers)](tools/README.md) — the agent's tool inventory lives here: HA, Plex, Music Assistant, general, Qdrant, MQTT, GitHub, plus a tool-development guide.
- [Conversation history](conversation-history.md) — how timed-out conversations get persisted to Postgres.
- [Autonomy engine (v1)](autonomy/README.md) — proactive background behaviors (morning briefing, ambient anomaly sweep) that wake on a schedule, run a tier-filtered autonomous turn, and notify via Signal message or HA push.
- [Revamp 2026](revamp-2026.md) — architectural notes on the April 2026 rewrite (Gradio removal, async FastAPI, dashboard, streaming).

## Responsibilities

- Core AI conversation engine
- Tool calling and function execution
- Session and conversation management
- Integration orchestration with sibling services

## Key components

- `selene_agent/selene_agent.py` — FastAPI app with lifespan, serves the SvelteKit SPA + `/api/*` + `/ws/*` + OpenAI-compat endpoints; mounts routers from `selene_agent/api/`.
- `selene_agent/orchestrator.py` — event-based agent loop (THINKING / TOOL_CALL / TOOL_RESULT / REASONING / METRIC / SUMMARY_RESET / DONE / ERROR). `REASONING` is dashboard-only chain-of-thought surfaced from reasoning-capable models (e.g. GLM-4.5-Air via vLLM's `--reasoning-parser glm45`); it's yielded on `/ws/chat` but filtered out of `/api/chat`'s response, never appended to `self.messages`, never persisted to `conversation_db` or `turn_metrics`, and `/v1/chat/completions` naturally drops it. with per-turn LLM and tool-call timing instrumentation. Each conversation session owns its own `AgentOrchestrator` instance (messages, `session_id`, `last_query_time`); singletons (OpenAI client, MCP manager, model, tools) are shared across all sessions. `SUMMARY_RESET` is yielded at turn start when `_check_session_timeout` compacted the session just before the incoming turn — the client renders an inline "Conversation summarized" marker above the next assistant reply.
- `selene_agent/utils/session_pool.py` — `SessionOrchestratorPool` keyed by `session_id`, with per-session `asyncio.Lock`, LRU cap (64), 30s background idle sweep, cold-resume from `conversation_db`, and shutdown flush. `/api/chat` and `/ws/chat` route through the pool; `/v1/chat/completions` builds an ephemeral orchestrator per request and never touches the pool. The autonomy engine also bypasses the pool (it already builds its own ephemeral orchestrators per task in `autonomy/turn.py`). The pool also exposes a per-session pub/sub surface (`subscribe(sid) → asyncio.Queue`, `unsubscribe`, `publish`) so background tasks can reach connected WS clients out-of-band — the idle sweep uses it to push `summary_reset` frames when a session is compacted between turns.
- `selene_agent/providers/` — pluggable LLM provider seam (`vllm`, `anthropic`, `openai` stub). Every agent call goes through `provider_getter() -> LLMProvider`, a closure over `app.state.provider` that resolves live on each turn so the dashboard System-page toggle takes effect without a session rebuild. `/v1/chat/completions` is pinned to vLLM regardless of the toggle. See [LLM provider toggle](#llm-provider-toggle) below.
- `selene_agent/utils/mcp_client_manager.py` — MCP client that discovers and executes tools from MCP servers, with a `UnifiedTool` abstraction.
- `selene_agent/utils/conversation_db.py` — PostgreSQL conversation persistence. See [Conversation history](conversation-history.md).

### Session identity on the wire

| Surface | Client → server | Server → client |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/chat` | `X-Session-Id` request header (optional); `X-Idle-Timeout: <seconds>` (optional, per-session); `X-Device-Name: <label>` (optional, satellite/client label) | `X-Session-Id` response header |
| `WS /ws/chat` | First frame `{"type":"session","session_id":"...","idle_timeout":N,"device_name":"..."}` (all fields optional; `idle_timeout` and `device_name` may also be sent on later session frames mid-stream) | First frame `{"type":"session","session_id":"..."}` |
| `POST /v1/chat/completions` | — (ignored; stateless, no device-name attribution) | — |

Missing/unknown `session_id` → the pool mints a new UUID and returns it. Known `session_id` that isn't in memory → the pool cold-resumes from `conversation_db` and rehydrates the orchestrator (calls `prepare()` to prepend the L4 block without clobbering restored messages). `device_name` rides with every flushed history row and is denormalized onto every `turn_metrics` row so the dashboard can render human-readable labels instead of opaque session ids — see [Conversation history → Device attribution](conversation-history.md#device-attribution).

## API endpoints

All endpoints live on a single port (6002). The SvelteKit dashboard is built into the image and served as static files by FastAPI — there is no Gradio.

## LLM provider toggle

The agent's text-to-text LLM calls are routed through a pluggable provider
abstraction in `selene_agent/providers/`. STT/TTS always stay local.

| Provider | Default model | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `vllm` | `gpt-3.5-turbo` (served name for the local GLM-4.5-Air-AWQ-FP16Mix) | Default. Direct `AsyncOpenAI` wrapper — zero translation overhead. Captures `reasoning` / `reasoning_content` extras from vLLM's reasoning-parser output and surfaces them as dashboard-only `REASONING` events; also strips any residual `<think>…</think>` blocks from content defensively. |
| `anthropic` | `claude-opus-4-7` | Uses the official `AsyncAnthropic` SDK. Translates OpenAI-shaped messages ↔ Anthropic `tool_use`/`tool_result` blocks; strips `temperature`/`top_p` for Opus 4.7 (rejected by the API), forwards them for older Anthropic models. |
| `openai` | — | Stubbed; falls back to vLLM with a warning. |

**Switching**: Dashboard → **System** → **Agent LLM Provider**. The
change is live on the next turn; no restart, no session rebuild. The
selection is persisted to the `agent_state` table (`llm_provider` key)
and survives container restarts. Seeded on first boot from `LLM_PROVIDER`
env var; after that the DB wins.

**What is not affected**: `/v1/chat/completions` (OpenAI-compat external
surface for the voice pipeline) is pinned to vLLM regardless of the
toggle — voice satellites keep talking to the local model even when the
dashboard is pointed at Anthropic.

**Prompt caching (Anthropic only)**: when the Anthropic provider is
active, three ephemeral `cache_control` breakpoints are attached to
every request — the last tool entry (caches the tools array), the system
block (caches tools + system), and the last conversation message (caches
the accumulated history). 5-minute TTL, refreshed on each hit. Cache
hits and writes are logged at INFO, e.g.
`[anthropic] cache read=12963 create=79 input=5 output=76`.

The same counters are also plumbed through to `turn_metrics`: the
`LLMProvider` protocol exposes `pop_last_cache_stats() -> {"read", "create"}`
(stash-and-reset semantics — the Anthropic provider captures the usage
fields on each call, vLLM and the OpenAI stub return zeros). The
orchestrator sums these across a turn's LLM iterations and writes them
to the new `cache_read_tokens` / `cache_creation_tokens` columns, which
the Metrics dashboard renders as a "Cache hit rate (7d)" tile
(`read / (read + create)`).

## Performance tuning

- **Memory management**: conversation history cleanup
- **Tool optimization**: parallel tool execution
- **Response caching**: repeated query optimization
- **GPU utilization**: efficient model inference
